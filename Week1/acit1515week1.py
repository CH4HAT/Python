    python is object-oriented language

    two ways we can run python (.py) files
        scripts - self contained program/aplication
        modules - file that is included in other python(.py) file  


    Python relies on indentation for blocks of code

Data Types 

    Strings - any sequence of characters inside of quotes
    Boolean - True/false 
    Numeric types -
    to get datatype we use function type()  example is print(type(x)), it will return data type of varable x

"""
"""
While adding string we can just put f inside of the brackets in th eprint function and enclose the variable in the epretheses and that should represent the assigned value and will return the values not the variable itself.
    x=hello
    y= hi
    print(f'{x} is saying hello to {y}')
